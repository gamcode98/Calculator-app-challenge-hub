## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See the size of the elements adjust based on their device's screen size
- Perform mathmatical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Adjust the color theme based on their preference
- **Bonus**: Have their initial theme preference checked using `prefers-color-scheme` and have any additional changes saved in the browser

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript vanilla

### What I learned

With this project I've improved my ability with JavaScript, manipulating the DOM, and using CSS custom properties to change the appearance theme.

### Continued development

This is an update to this readme file. This was almost 2 years ago. I've learned a lot in the process.
This was a great learning experience for me to continue to improve and learn more about JavaScript and in these moments I'm still learning but with frameworks like React I can continue to build my projects.
